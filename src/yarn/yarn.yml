    steps:
      - save_cache:

          paths:
            - ./node_modules

  # If there isn't a match to the first key, it'll do a partial match of the
  # second. That means after the first cache save there will always be a cache
  # hit, but it might be an older version of the cache

  # By default when yarn runs it does not check the filesystem to ensure the
  # packages it expects to be installed are actually installed. Using the
  # --check-files flag ensures that any packages or files missing or out of date
  # on the file system (i.e. those which might be restored from cache) match what
  # the yarn.lock file specifies

    steps:
      - run: yarn --check-files
